## Exercise

 This workweek we focushed in Testing our application by using JUnit Jupiter, the principles and logic about testing applications. We saw especially the usage of framework of mockito for testing complex clases and clases which are connected to any server or web page. 
 The excercise of this week was just make the testing of a method of our academy project which tries to connect to a web page and use it, differentiating if the connects may fail because of web page of invalid parameters, for more complex, the clase we had to test was abstract type.
