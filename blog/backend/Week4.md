## Exercise

This week we went deeper in the use of REST Controller and how to use it for making requests to a HTML web, also we saw possible responses from a web to a requests and how to implement it. In the end we took a look the academy project and Roberto Auro told us some changes that would be fine for the project and proposed us as exercise advance in academy project following this structure: (Being Job a model class)
  client -> submits job -> Job (id, url, status) -> gets persisted
  JobExecutor -> picks jobs from persistence -> executes them -> persists result
  client -> get job info (id) -> job is running/job completed and gets result
