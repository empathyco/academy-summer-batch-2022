## Exercise
After a meeting with our mentor of the Backend team, we had to create a Spring Boot application that implements a calculator accessible via HTTP, implementing a controller with at least 4 endpoints, one for each one of the basic arithmetic operations. We also had to implements tests and logging for all the clases we have created. Then, we had to add a basic Dockerfile to run the application just by doing in console:
 - mvn clean package
 - docker build -t calculator:latest .
 - docker run -p8080:8080 calculator:latest
