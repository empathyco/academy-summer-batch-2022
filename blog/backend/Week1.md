## Exercise
After an initial meeting with our mentor of the Backend team, we had to create a maven project with some funcionality and then install it on our maven repository. Then, we created a new project with two different modules, one of a regular java app and the other as a SpringBoot app. Both modules should use the funcionality of the previous library created through maven
