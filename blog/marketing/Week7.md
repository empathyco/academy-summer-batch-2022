# Week 7: Marketing
This week was focused on market research for motive.co, overseeing LinkedIn Ads activity and pitching the recommedations to the agency. I provided proper insights and detected an issue with the landing page, as the contact submissions were not being properly registered, which could lead to us losing prospects. I also updated the audience report for motive.co, helped our event manager with some tasks and attended a meeting with a new agency for paid social activities.
